## 🔗 Interaction & Physics Engine

To achieve "billions of outcomes," modules are not static. They interact through **Cross-Engine Mapping**:

1.  **SDF as Gravity:** Mesh objects (Type B) can use the SDF distance (Type A) to calculate collision or attraction.
2.  **Audio-Reactive Physics:**
    *   **Gravity:** Swaps between -9.8 (earth) and 0 (space) on song breakdowns.
    *   **Wind:** Driven by the `highIntensity` band, pushing particles around.
3.  **The "Drunk" Camera:** A camera that uses 3D noise to wander through the generated world, ensuring we never see the same angle twice.
4.  **Seed-Sync:** Every song's unique ID acts as a random seed. If you play the same song again, the "Infinite" engine recreates its specific visual fingerprint.
